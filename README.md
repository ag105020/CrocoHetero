Preparation:
Download all the files and put it in one folder.
In each file, path must be adjusted to your own computer.

Fig. 5a,b
Run 617_04_20_07_test_T26.py

Fig. 5c,d
1. Run 617_04_22_04_Stack_Dd_normalized_by_Vch_T26.py with "CreatingNormal = 0", which will produce the result with Rv = 1
2. Run the same file with "CreatingNormal = 1"
* make sure to adjust the path.

Fig. 6a,b
1. Run 631_00_06_2D_Rn_Ef_HighRes02.py
2. For plotting, run 641_00_09_2D_optRn_N2FixMax.py
* make sure to adjust the path.

Fig. 6c,d
1. Run 617_04_22_04_Stack_Dd_normalized_by_Vch_T26.py with "CreatingNormal = 0", which will produce the result with Rv = 1
2. Run 633_00_07_2D_Dd_Rn_HighRes02_T26.py
3. Run 643_00_11_OptRn.py
* make sure to adjust the path.
